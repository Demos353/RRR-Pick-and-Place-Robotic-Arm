# RRR Pick and Place Robotic Arm
ü§ñ A versatile and customizable robotic arm for automated pick and place operations, featuring a unique Rotary-Rotary-Rotary (RRR) design for enhanced flexibility.

## Features

- **Triple Rotary Design:** Increased dexterity and range of motion.
- **Pick and Place Functionality:** Ideal for sorting, assembly, and packaging tasks.
- **Modular and Customizable:** Easily adapt the arm for specific applications.
- **Open Source:** Collaborate and innovate with the robotics community.

## Hardware Requirements

Materials: 3D Printing or Aluminum for robot system body.
Main Controller: Arduino UNO or MEGA
Needed Components: 
- 2* M995 Servo Motor (Full Metal Gear) with a rotation of 180 degrees for the robot two joints. 
- 1* M995 Full Metal Gear Servo Motor of 360 degrees for the base. 
- 1* SG90 Full Metal Gear Servo Motor of 180 degrees for the gripper to be able to catch the ball. 
- 1* Bluetooth Module HC 05 for remote control of the robotic arm in the second mode. 
- A Bluetooth Mobile Application to serially connect to the Arduino Bluetooth module. 
- 2* 3.7 Lithium Ion batteries with their charger and cap to connect them to the servo motor's power and power them. 
- Power bank or adaptor to power the Arduino while doing the pick and place task. 


## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE or VS Code (Platform.io)
- CAD software for customization
- Motion planning and execution software
